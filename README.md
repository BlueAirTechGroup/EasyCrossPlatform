Test Env: Windows 10 + Visual Studio 2017 | Ubuntu LTS16.04LTS + g++<br />

## Develop Theory
Everybody Loves C++, but there is actually no user-friendly libs for beginners to start using C++ with full support of network and multithreading function, while covering the hardware and underlying technologies. <br />
Influenced by <a href="http://reasoning.biz" target="_blank">Reasoning</a> Library, however, that library is no longer maintained since 2008<br />
With less code, developers can develop more safe code preventing memory leaks and debug less. EasyCrossPlatform also brings noticeable performance while enabling developers to develop codes fast and secure.<br />
## Installation
No need for install currently, but you need to include all the CPP and H files.
